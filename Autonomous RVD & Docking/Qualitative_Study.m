%% First contact %% 
% This scripts provides a first contact with the RVD project. The objective
% is to qualitatively analyze whether the Clohessy-Whiltshire
% relative motion linear model could be use in the CR3BP problem. 

% The relative motion of two spacecraft in a halo orbit around L1 in the
% Earth-Moon system is analyzed both from the direct integration of the
% equations of motion and with the CW model %
